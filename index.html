      <h1>The Dead Internet Theory</h1>
      <h2><em>Is the internet really run by bots?</em></h2>
      <p><br/>The Dead Internet Theory claims that 
        <br/> most online activity is generated by
        <br/> artificial intelligence. According
        <br/> to this theory, much of what we see
        <br/>  on the internet, especially on social 
        <br/> media, is largely "fake" and created by
        <br/> bots rather than real people. </p>

    <section id="section2" class="section">
      <h2>Online discussions around the 
      "Dead Internet Theory" often 
      <br/>reflect broader fears about 
      artificial intelligence, 
      <br/>including misconceptions about
      about the extent that these
      <br/>systems influence what we see 
      online and that they may 
      <br/> eventually "take over".</h2>

      <br/>"It feels like my feed is just random AI-generated stuff now" <em>- Random Reddit User</em>
      <br/>"It's getting hard to distinguish what's real online and what's fake" <em>- Harvard Student, '25</em>
      <br/>"I feel like everyone has this perception that everything is AI-generated now, even when it isn't." <em>- Harvard Student, '26</em>

      <h1>But is the internet really full of bots?</h1>
      <p><br/>Despite the viral claim that "the internet is
      <br/>dead," empirical research shows otherwise. 
      <br/>Automated accounts are widespread, but they 
      <br/>make up a minority of total internet traffic 
      <br/>and most engagement still comes from humans.</p>

      <h1>So...is the internet "dead"?</h1>
      <p><br/>No! Bots are real, but they're not taking over. Humans are still the main creators online</p>
      <p><br/>What this does tell us, though, is digital literacy is important, and we have to stay
      <br/> knowledgeable about the technology we use so it doesn't become this scary, ominous 
      <br/>thing that we can't explain</p>
